#
### usage
Running `make` to generate the fdf executable. You can run the program with `./fdf [valid_fdf_file]`.

A valid fdf file will consist of a matrix of number delimited by spaces. Each number's position represents an (x , y) coordinate with the value of the number itself representing a height (z).

Valid fdf files will always have the same number of elements per row.

Example:
```
$> cat -e 42.fdf
